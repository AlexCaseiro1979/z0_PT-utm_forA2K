# z0_PT-utm_forA2K

This is the set-up of a register file for Portugal to be used with the AUSTAL2000 dispersion model.

The scripts treatment.sh and deASCparaDMNT.sh were used to build the .dmna and .dmnt.gz files (to be used by AUSTAL2000) from the CORINE LAND COVER 2006 files. See the comments wthin the scripts for more information.

The implementation is in the Test0*/ directories.
The file 'Tests ' explains how to use the register files.
